Hello whoever is reading this, 

This folder is hooked up to automatically fill out the page header images.
The image will automatically appear when added to this folder and the site is refreshed.
You'll notice a new image bubble appear, click on that and you can view the image.

I believe infinite images can be added, although I don't know why you'd want to do that, 
if you do add too many images there will be a lot of image bubbles and it will look very broken.

If only one image is added there will be no image bubble.

If no images are in this foler then it will just a darker version of the background.
