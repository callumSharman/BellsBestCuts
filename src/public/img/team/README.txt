Hello whoever is reading this, 

This folder is hooked up to automatically fill out the "meat the team" section.
The image will automatically appear when added to this folder and the site is refreshed.
The name of the image determines the name that appears under the image.

Names are generated as such: underscores become spaces.
    e.g. liam_bell.jpg becomes Liam Bell
         nathan_sharman.png becomes Nathan Sharman

To pick the order they are displayed, just put the number before the file name
    e.g. 1_liam_bell.jpg
         2_mitch_bell.jpg
